## Introduction
This program serves as a learning resource for understanding different sorting algorithms commonly used in computer science. It provides a hands-on experience by allowing users to visualize and analyze the performance of these algorithms through a simple command-line interface.

## Features
- Implementation of popular sorting algorithms.
- Customizable input array size and elements.
- Detailed performance metrics (time complexity) for each algorithm.-(WIP)
- Easy-to-understand command-line interface.

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Compile the source code (if necessary).
4. Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to input array parameters and choose sorting algorithms.


## Supported Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are currently supported:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- 
## Work In Progress
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
